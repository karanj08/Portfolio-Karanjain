          <br />
          As a mechanical engineer turned web developer, I thrive on the
          intersection of creativity and logic. My journey began with gears and
          engines, but now I&apos;m passionate about crafting elegant and
          functional digital experiences.

          The dynamic world of web technologies captivated me, and I decided to
          dive headfirst into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love turning design
          concepts into interactive websites that engage users and solve
          real-world problems. I&apos;m always exploring new frameworks,
          libraries, and best practices. I believe in the power of collaboration
          and continuous improvement.
